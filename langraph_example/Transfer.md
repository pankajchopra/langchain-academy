# ===== CLOUD FOUNDRY BUILDPACK BEHAVIOR =====

“””
Cloud Foundry Python Buildpack Dependency Resolution Order:

1. Checks for requirements.txt in root → pip install -r requirements.txt
1. If no requirements.txt, checks setup.py → pip install .
1. If both exist, requirements.txt takes PRECEDENCE

This means: Keep setup.py minimal, use requirements.txt for all dependencies!
“””

# ===== CORRECT APPROACH: Minimal setup.py =====

# setup.py (Keep this MINIMAL)

from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
name=‘my-cf-app’,
version=‘1.0.0’,
description=‘Cloud Foundry Python Application’,
author=‘Your Name’,
author_email=‘your.email@company.com’,
packages=find_packages(),
python_requires=’>=3.11’,

```
# ✅ MINIMAL - Only core runtime dependencies that define your package
install_requires=[
    'Flask>=2.3.3',         # Core web framework
    'gunicorn>=21.2.0',     # WSGI server
],

# ✅ Include package data and config files
include_package_data=True,
zip_safe=False,

# Package metadata
classifiers=[
    'Development Status :: 4 - Beta',
    'Intended Audience :: Developers',
    'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.11',
],
```

)

# ===== COMPREHENSIVE requirements.txt =====

# ===== WHY THIS APPROACH WORKS =====

“””
Cloud Foundry Python Buildpack Process:

1. Upload & Extract:
- cf push uploads your zip file
- Buildpack extracts to /tmp/staged/app/
1. Dependency Detection:
   /tmp/staged/app/
   ├── my_app/
   ├── setup.py          ← Buildpack sees this
   ├── requirements.txt   ← Buildpack prioritizes this!
   ├── Procfile
   └── .pip/pip.conf     ← Buildpack uses this for repo config
1. Dependency Installation:
- Buildpack finds requirements.txt
- Runs: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Uses your .pip/pip.conf for Artifactory
- Installs all 100+ packages from your internal repo
1. Application Start:
- Uses Procfile to start your app
- All dependencies are available

# ===== BUILDPACK DETECTION LOGIC =====

“””
Python Buildpack Decision Tree:

1. requirements.txt exists in root?
   → YES: pip install -r requirements.txt (✅ Your case)
   → NO: Go to step 2
1. setup.py exists?
   → YES: pip install . (uses install_requires)
   → NO: Skip dependency installation
1. Both exist?
   → requirements.txt takes priority
   → setup.py install_requires is IGNORED

# ===== VERIFICATION SCRIPT =====

# ===== COMMON ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID =====

“””
❌ DON’T DO THIS - Duplicating packages in setup.py:

setup(
install_requires=[
‘Flask==2.3.3’,
‘SQLAlchemy==2.0.23’,
‘pandas==2.1.3’,
‘numpy==1.25.2’,
‘boto3==1.29.7’,
# … copying all 100+ packages
]
)

Problems:

- Duplication and maintenance nightmare
- Version conflicts between setup.py and requirements.txt
- CF buildpack ignores install_requires when requirements.txt exists
- Violates separation of concerns

✅ DO THIS - Minimal setup.py + comprehensive requirements.txt:

# setup.py

install_requires=[
‘Flask>=2.3.3’,      # Only core framework
‘gunicorn>=21.2.0’,  # Only WSGI server
]

# requirements.txt (all 100+ packages with exact versions)

Flask==2.3.3
gunicorn==21.2.0
SQLAlchemy==2.0.23
pandas==2.1.3

# … all other packages

# ===== DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES =====

“””
For Large Applications with 100+ Dependencies:

1. Use requirements.txt for ALL runtime dependencies
1. Consider requirements-dev.txt for development dependencies
1. Use pip-tools for dependency management:
- requirements.in (high-level dependencies)
- requirements.txt (pinned versions from pip-compile)
1. Example structure:
   requirements/
   ├── base.txt           # Core dependencies
   ├── production.txt     # Prod-specific (monitoring, etc.)
   ├── development.txt    # Dev tools (testing, linting)
   └── requirements.txt   # Combined for CF deployment
   “””

# ===== CICD BUILD VERIFICATION =====

“””

# In your CI/CD pipeline, add verification:

- name: Verify Package Structure
  script:
  - python setup.py sdist –formats=zip
  - unzip -t dist/my-cf-app-1.0.0.zip
  - unzip -l dist/my-cf-app-1.0.0.zip | grep requirements.txt
  - echo “✅ requirements.txt included in package”
  - unzip -l dist/my-cf-app-1.0.0.zip | grep “.pip/pip.conf”
  - echo “✅ pip.conf included in package”
    “””

# ===== FINAL RECOMMENDATION =====

“””
For your 100+ package Cloud Foundry application:

✅ Keep setup.py minimal (only Flask + gunicorn)
✅ Put ALL 100+ packages in requirements.txt  
✅ CF buildpack will automatically use requirements.txt
✅ Your Artifactory configuration will work perfectly
✅ No duplication or maintenance issues

This is the standard, scalable approach used by enterprise CF deployments.

**No, you should NOT include all 100+ packages in `install_requires` in setup.py!**

You’re absolutely right - the Cloud Foundry Python buildpack will automatically pick up and install from `requirements.txt` when it’s in the root of your zip file. This is the standard and recommended approach.

Here’s why and how it works:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

## Summary:

**✅ Correct Approach:**

- **setup.py**: Keep minimal (only 2-3 core packages like Flask, gunicorn)
- **requirements.txt**: All 100+ packages with exact versions
- **CF Buildpack**: Automatically finds and uses `requirements.txt`

**Why this works:**

1. **CF Python buildpack priority**: `requirements.txt` > `setup.py`
1. **Separation of concerns**: setup.py defines the package, requirements.txt defines runtime environment
1. **No duplication**: Maintain dependencies in one place
1. **Buildpack automatically runs**: `pip install -r requirements.txt` using your Artifactory config

**Key verification:**

```bash
# After running: python setup.py sdist --formats=zip
unzip -l dist/my-cf-app-1.0.0.zip | grep requirements.txt
# Should show: requirements.txt in the zip root
```

The buildpack will find `requirements.txt` in your zip file root and install all 100+ packages from your internal Artifactory repository. This is exactly how it’s designed to work!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
